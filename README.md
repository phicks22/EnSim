3D Spatial Protein Interactions

### Purpose
To implement a spacial model that predicts and visualizes 3-dimensional spatial interactions
of proteins. Functional groups that construct the protein are categorized according to their
molecular reactivity with other functional groups. The resulting binding conformation is graphed 
3-dimensionally to display the optimized interaction based upon the molecules' functional groups.
